# Synthesizer
Synthesizer matlab application 
# Files
piano1.mlapp - is the main file, for this app I used the Matlab App Designer, the other files are just helpers (like readmidi and writemidi...) the writers are credited in the discription of each file.
# Filters
The user can apply multiple filters such as : high/low pass, ADSR frequency or amplitude envelope, wave such as sin wave, saw and square wave.
# Algorithms used
In this project I used note detection algorithms such as zero-crossing, autocorrelation and more.
# Playing Midi files
The user can apply these filters on a midi file and play it.
# Other
This project was part of DSP course 2019, thanks to Tomer Gal my lecturer for helping me out on this.
