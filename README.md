# Overview
Synthesizer is my first matlab application, it's a synthesizer simulator, with some filters and effects used in actual synthesizers. 
This project was part of DSP course, thanks to Tomer Gal my lecturer for guiding me and helping me out.

# Files
piano1.mlapp - is the main file, for this app I used the Matlab App Designer, the other files are just helpers (like readmidi and writemidi...) the writers are credited in the discription of each file.

# Fetures 

#### Filters
The user can apply multiple filters such as : high/low pass, ADSR frequency or amplitude envelope, and wave type such as sin wave, saw and square wave.
#### Algorithms used
In this project I used note detection algorithms such as zero-crossing, autocorrelation and more.

#### Playing Midi files
The user can apply these filters on a midi file and play it.
